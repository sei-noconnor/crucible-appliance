## Features

- **SSO Authentication (Keycloak):** Secure and centralized authentication across all services within the appliance, simplifying user management.
- **Git Server (Gitea):** Embedded Gitea server for streamlined in-cluster version control and collaboration.
- **Cert-Manager:** Automates certificate management, including the use of a "crucible.local" root CA, ensuring secure communication.
- **CI/CD (ArgoCD):** Enables continuous integration and continuous deployment with ArgoCD for seamless application updates and rollbacks.
- **Offline Registry Cache:** Utilizes the built-in registry cache of k3s to support offline deployments, reducing dependencies on external registries.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
export REPO_URL=https://github.com/your-username/packer-appliance-ovf.git
git clone $REPO_URL
cd packer-appliance-ovf
```

## Build

### Building the Appliance

The Crucible appliance is tested on vSphere 8, ensuring seamless compatibility and optimal performance. To start with Crucible, follow these steps:

1.  **Copy the Variable File:**

    ```bash
      `cp appliance.yaml.example appliance.yaml`
    ```

````
2.  **Customize Your Environment:**

 Modify the `appliance.yaml` file to match your environment. This includes setting the vSphere server, user credentials, datacenter, cluster, datastore, and network details. Ensure these settings match your vSphere configuration to avoid deployment errors.

 ```yaml
   vars:
      vsphere_server: vcsa.example.com
      vsphere_user: administrator@vsphere.local
      vsphere_password: pasword1234!@
      datacenter: Datacenter1
      cluster: Cluster1
      datastore: ds1
      network_name: "VM Network"`
````

3.  **Initiate the Build:**

```bash
   make build
```

4.  **Import into vSphere:**

    Upon successful completion of the Packer build process, an OVF directory will be located in the `./output` folder. Import this OVF into your vSphere environment.
